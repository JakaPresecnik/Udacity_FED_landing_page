# LANDING PAGE PROJECT

- This is a project for **Udacity**'s **Front End Developer** Nanogegree.
  - It is the 2nd project for FED.
- Starter code is from here: https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page
- The project demonstrates some knowledge of manipulating the DOM with javascript.
- app.js was done from scratch and this is what it does:
  - loops through sections and creates nav-menu based on them
  - highlights the section if they are in users view
  - adds a back to top anchor button once user reaches the end of document
  - ads a smooth scroll effect upon clicking the nav-items (add-on found here: https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll to get a scroll effect)
